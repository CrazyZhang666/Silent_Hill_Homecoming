Patch 1.25 - 2.00
The password is different.
You have a screenshot (hint.png).
You know that md5(PASSWORD)=D980415DAE31C581DEC198FC96C96D69 and PASSWORD = XYIsDeletedLocation.
You need to find two missing parts - X and Y.
Go to this place (JunkYard).
If you found all missing parts and combined them with existing word then you need to check it with any MD5 online service.
Good luck.
[X and Y = BlackForest].
And the password is....BlackForestIsDeletedLocation.

It was just a temporary decision against Steam006/His comrades/Konami.
But my code is my own code and no one will use it without my permission.
Pay respect or get the hell out of here.
If Konami is actually planning to delete anything. Well. Let it be. But it will not stop me.
