Warning! 
Versions <=1.22 are free to access.
Patch 1.23+ is password protected.
The password is my nickname in hex [UpperCase].
And the password is....756E6B6E6F776E70726F6A656374

Patch 1.25
The password is different.
You have a screenshot (hint.png).
You know that md5(PASSWORD)=D980415DAE31C581DEC198FC96C96D69 and PASSWORD = XYIsDeletedLocation.
You need to find two missing parts - X and Y.
Go to this place (JunkYard).
If you found all missing parts and combined them with existing word then you need to check it with any MD5 online service.
Good luck.
[X and Y = BlackForest].
And the password is....BlackForestIsDeletedLocation.

You are not allowed to share the password to anyone. 
Pay respect or get the hell out of here.
