INITIAL RELEASE.
THIS PATCH WILL BE THE ONE OF THE LATEST FIXES FOR THE GAME AND WILL BE AIMED TO SUPPORT MODERN WINDOWS INCLUDING WDDM GRAPHICAL DRIVER MODEL WITHOUT LOOSING INITIAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
[Note: If you planning to play the game on higher resolution you need to have more physical/graphical RAM]

-New WDDM fixes all ALT-TAB related issues;
-It's better to enchance the game code with new features instead of using DirectX9 backward compatibility;
[Note: Initial release already includes WDDM model via DirectX9EX support]
